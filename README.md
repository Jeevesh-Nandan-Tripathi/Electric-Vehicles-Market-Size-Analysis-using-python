# Electric-Vehicles-Market-Size-Analysis-using-python

I have analyzed datasets related to electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on uncovering meaningful insights and providing actionable recommendations. I filtered EVs based on budget and range criteria, grouped them by manufacturer, and calculated average battery capacities. To identify patterns, I visualized the relationship between battery capacity and range and detected outliers in energy consumption. Additionally, I developed an EV recommendation system in Python that allows users to input their budget, desired range, and battery capacity to find the best matches. Using hypothesis testing, I compared the engine power of Tesla and Audi vehicles, drawing insights that informed strategic recommendations.
